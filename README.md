# Wordle-solver

This project deals with the final project wordle-solver provided in the programming practice course. The program is not interacting with the wordle available online, and the answer to the wordle above is hard-coded in the code. In the above project, we tried to reduce the number of gues through vowels and frequently used alphabets. In addition, it was produced by directly implementing the linked list as a project conducted for practical purposes.
